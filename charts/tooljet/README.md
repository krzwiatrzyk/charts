## Init

After ToolJet has been successfuly deployed, run `npm run db:seed` to initialize database data and create default user (login: `dev@tooljet.io`, password: `password`)

## ToDo's:

[] - add guide how to create own user using database access
[] - add configurable values that will allow to seed database
